# Snale

### My approach on creating a stack-based programming language.
### Pronounced as "snail", it's heavily inspired by Forth. It's mostly spaghetti code, and it doesn't have a compiler, so it's quite slow.
### Important!!! : every .snale file must end with a space or a new line, otherwise the code won't run properly.
